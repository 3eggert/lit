# Lost in translation
### Rails i18n web interface

Translate your apps with pleasure (sort of...) and for free

Highly inspired by Copycopter

### Instalation

Add ```lit``` gem to your ```Gemfile```
```[ruby]
gem "lit"
```

### ToDo

* Rewrite initializer
* Support for array types (ie. ```date.abbr_day_names```)
* Better cache
* Support for other key value providers (ie. Redis does not support Array types in easy way)
* Integration with ActiveAdmin
